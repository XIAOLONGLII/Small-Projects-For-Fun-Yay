RECAP:
    With linear regression the objective was to create a model that best fits our data. 

    
OBJECTIVE:
    The objextive with classification is to create a model that best devides or seperates our data.

NOTES:
The objective of this model is to devide or separate our data. It separates points into seperate groups. It closters!. 

Classification != clustering. Clustering is assinging points to seperate groups.In classification the objective is to create a model that properly devides groups, but also predicts which group does a pint belong. A algorithm can be chosen for this.

K = the number of closest points. 

Then a percentage is calculated from the types of K nearest points. 

Confidence equals the percentage of same types points found within the closest  K points. 

Confidence does not equal accuracy. 

Euclid discanec is what used to estimate the closest K points. 

k nearest nightboors is not very good for scaling. Estimations can also be done in paralle

most macine learning algorithms want a category to be a number that represents a type.
